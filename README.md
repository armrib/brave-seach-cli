# Brave seach cli
A CLI to access brave search result browserless !
I use w3m to browse in the command line.
If Codellm or Summarize is not available, the script fall back to w3m browsing.

## To use it
You can put the function in your .bashrc or load it from there.

## Side notes
To use CodeLLM, a search has to be done before.
Summarize works the same way.

## Improvements
You can create issues or pull request directly to improve it.
